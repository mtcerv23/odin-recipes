      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Orange sauce</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, add orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and red chili flakes. 
                Heat for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 Tablespoons of water to form a paste. 
                Add to orange sauce and whisk together. Continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the mixture 
                begins to thicken. Once the sauce is thickened, remove from heat and add orange zest.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3>Chicken</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Place flour and cornstarch in a shallow dish or pie plate. Add a pinch of salt. Stir.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture and then flour mixture. Place on plate.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 -3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Using a thermometer, 
                watch for it to reach 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook several chicken pieces at a time. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes, turning often 
                until golden brown. Place chicken on a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat.</li>
            <li>Toss chicken with orange sauce. You may reserve some of the sauce to place on rice. Serve it 
                with a sprinkling of green onion and orange zest, if so desired.</li>
