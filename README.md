# odin-recipes
This project consists of a website containing a bunch of recipes. I'll probably put some keto recipes or something. Idk.
Since we haven't learned CSS yet, this project will be a demonstration of the basic commands of HTML I have learned so far, which include:
bold and italic, linking to other websites/pages on my website, embedding images, adding alt text for those images, etc.
